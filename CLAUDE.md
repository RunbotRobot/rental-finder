# Working notes for Claude

- The owner works from a phone. When you open a pull request, merge it
  yourself once it's ready (tests pass, live checks done) — don't wait for
  a manual merge. Anything that would normally need a terminal (wrangler,
  secrets) should come with dashboard/browser instructions instead.
- Run `python -m pytest tests/` before every push.
- Every distance the tool reports must come from a street address; never
  let an unverified check read as a pass. See `rental_finder/compliance.py`
  and `models.py` for the invariant.
- Licensed family-home child care isn't in any open dataset. Don't claim
  coverage for it anywhere.
